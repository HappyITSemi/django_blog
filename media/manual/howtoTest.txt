Command options
> -v {0,1,2,3} --verbosity {0,1,2,3}
Execution log detail level,
If you set it to level 3, you can see when the database is changed, etc., so it is easier to understand if you use this option in the beginning.

>-k --keepdb
The default behavior of automated tests is to recreate the database every time.
This option avoids the re-creation and leaves the database without deleting it, and reuses it the next time it is run.

> --settings SETTINGS
With a single configuration file (settings.py), it is difficult to configure the production, development, and automated test environments separately.

<How to split the configuration file>.
